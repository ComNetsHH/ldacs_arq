  abstract = {Ubiquitous object networking has sparked the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), which defines a new era in the world of networking. Realization of this concept needs to be addressed by standardization efforts that will shape the infrastructure of the networks. This has been achieved through the IEEE 802.15.4e, 6LoWPAN, and IPv6 standards. In addition, the IEEE 802.15.4e standard, which can be considered as the backbone of the IoT structure, has presented timeslotted channel hopping (TSCH). Although these standards provide a coherent and diffused system, several implications challenge these standards to achieve optimal performance and reliability. Node mobility can be considered as the delimited factor for realizing a fully connected network, especially with the inclusion of TSCH mode that will complicate the association process of the mobile nodes, as a result of the frequency hopping mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mobility over the TSCH sensor network, and a Markov chain model is presented to determine the parameters that affect mobile node association process. Second, we provide a proposed mobility-aware Mobile Timeslotted Channel Hopping (MTSCH) protocol that will facilitate the mobile nodes association and minimize the latency incurred by leaving the nodes dissociated from the network. TSCH and the proposed MTSCH techniques have been implemented and evaluated through Contiki OS. The proposed MTSCH manages to reduce the radio duty cycle of the mobile nodes by an average of 30\% while increasing the connectivity of the nodes by 25\%. Moreover, cluster heads managed to save energy by a ratio of 14\%.},

  author = {{Bellido-Manganell}, Miguel A. and Schnell, Michael},
  abstract = {The increasing air traffic foreseen for the next
decades has triggered an extensive modernization of the air traffic
management. Specifically, new air traffic services and operational
concepts have been defined and shall be supported during all
phases of flight by a set of modern digital data links integrated
into a single communications network named the Future Commu-
nications Infrastructure (FCI). The air-to-air (A2A) component
of the FCI, the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications
System (LDACS) A2A mode, is currently in the initial stages of
its development. Given that the LDACS A2A mode must be able
to operate without any ground or satellite support, the data link
must provide means for the aircraft to establish and organize
an independent communications ad-hoc network, which imposes
a great challenge for the design of the data link and specially
for its medium-access control. In this paper, we contribute to
the development of the LDACS A2A mode by assessing the
performance of an A2A data link based on two different medium-
access protocols; ALOHA with and without diversity, and a
self-organizing time-division multiple-access (STDMA) scheme.
The performance is obtained by simulating the implemented
models of both the ALOHA-based and the STDMA-based A2A
data link for different design parameters, requirements, and air
traffic conditions. The obtained results show that the STDMA-
based A2A data link performs better than the ALOHA-based
A2A data link in most considered cases, given than the former
requires a lower bandwidth than the latter to achieve the desired
performance. Based on our analysis, we conclude that STDMA
is a better candidate than ALOHA with or without diversity for
the medium-access control of the LDACS A2A mode.},

By combining time slotted access with multi-channel and channel hopping capabilities, it is particularly suitable for critical applications that require high reliability and deterministic latency. In this paper we focus on the formation process of TSCH networks. This relies on periodic advertisement of Enhanced Beacons (EBs), however, the standard does not specify any advertising strategy. By taking a theoretical approach, we first derive a general model of the network formation process and provide an analytical formulation of the average joining time (i.e., the time taken by a node to join the network). Then, we derive an optimal strategy for scheduling EB transmissions that minimizes the average joining time. Finally, we propose a new Model-based Beacon Scheduling (MBS) algorithm that approximates the optimal strategy in real networks. We evaluate the performance of MBS by simulation. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous solutions present in the literature.},

Experiments are conducted in a testbed consisting of a single PC with virtual network interfaces to determine the influence of various parameter settings on performance. Results are compared against a scenario with one link offering the same capacity as the two links together. It is concluded that using two heterogeneous links is beneficial for the goodput and losses for generation sizes larger than 20 for three correlated lost packets on average.},

We first propose a mathematical programming approach consisting of two steps: the minimization of the weighted hop count (mWHC) subject to scheduling constraints, followed by average delay minimization for the previously computed routes. Since the computational complexity of this approach is prohibitive for larger networks, we also formulate a genetic algorithm (GA) that can be applied to larger networks and mobile networks. We analyze the performance of both approaches by means of simulations and compare the solution that they provide to a simple hop-count-based routing and gateway selection solution. It is shown that the performance of the GA is comparable with the mathematical programming approach in terms of delay and packet delivery ratio (PDR) at lower complexity and is significantly better than the hop-count-based solution.},

To overcome data rate, delay and cost limitations of SC and coverage limitations of DA2GC, one can extend DA2GC with air-to-air communication (A2AC) by enabling multi-hop communication. To investigate the A2AC performance, we construct a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem of DA2GC and A2AC, jointly considering interference in topology formation and flow assignment. Our objective is to maximize the number of aircraft that can be connected with a given specific minimum data rate threshold. The evaluation is performed for low aircraft density scenarios over the North Atlantic. We show that in the investigated scenarios, over 90 \% of aircraft can have at least 50 Mbps, some being up to 1600 kilometers away from the closest base station (BS). Furthermore, we identify antenna capabilities as an important factor for A2AC performance.},

  abstract = {Modern mobile networks in the era of 5G have ambitious performance goals. 
One envisioned goal is to have communication that is ultra-reliable and ultra-low latency (uRLLC).
To ensure reliability, Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) processes are usually deployed, sometimes combined with forward error correction.
As an evolution of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, 5G may be foreseen to use similar methods, and so we assume LTE's Hybrid ARQ on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, and a Selective Repeat ARQ on the Radio Link Control (RLC) layer.
Simulation of LTE systems is a time-consuming endeavor due to its complexity, and when latency and reliability are the key performance indicators, it may be preferable to isolate the ARQ processes.
In this manner, this paper presents a mathematical model of the two stacked ARQ processes that are used in today's LTE system.
It is based on the method of Signal Flow Graphs (SFGs) and allows the analysis of either ARQ process in isolation, and of both stacked on top of each other.
Analytic results are shown for a realistic set of parameters, and in the spirit of Open Science, the MATLAB implementation files are made available upon publication to interested researchers, so that verification and an adaption to similar ARQ processes is easily made.},

As an evolution of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, 5G may be foreseen to use similar methods, and so we assume LTE's Hybrid ARQ on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, and a Selective Repeat ARQ on the Radio Link Control (RLC) layer.
Simulation of LTE systems is a time-consuming endeavor due to its complexity, and when latency and reliability are the key performance indicators, it may be preferable to isolate the ARQ processes.
In this manner, this paper presents a mathematical model of the two stacked ARQ processes that are used in today's LTE system.
It is based on the method of Signal Flow Graphs (SFGs) and allows the analysis of either ARQ process in isolation, and of both stacked on top of each other.
Analytic results are shown for a realistic set of parameters, and in the spirit of Open Science, the MATLAB implementation files are made available upon publication to interested researchers, so that verification and an adaption to similar ARQ processes is easily made.},

A key requirement is to provide access to cellular services when the network is available and maintain local communication in the (partial) absence of the infrastructure. In this paper we propose and compare clustering schemes that are applicable for integrating D2D communications into cellular networks such that communication services can be maintained when the cellular infrastructure becomes partially dysfunctional. Our results show that there is a trade-off between coverage, energy efficiency and cluster formation delay and this trade-off can be handled by our proposed threshold-based clustering scheme.},

  abstract = {Aeronautical ad hoc networks represent a special type of ad hoc wireless networks, given their significantly larger scale and the distinct characteristics of their mobile nodes. Aircraft populate the international airspace very heterogeneously. Some regions experience highly dense air traffic, with aircraft headings being largely uncorrelated. Other regions remain only very sparsely populated, with aircraft typically flying parallel to each other. Moreover, the number of airborne aircraft in a given region changes significantly throughout the day. In this paper, we focus on the densely populated European airspace, and investigate the topological behavior of multihop ad hoc wireless networks formed by air-air links of varying communications range. We derive analytical expressions for various topological aspects, such as the lifetime of inter-aircraft links, and the projected hop length using greedy forwarding. These results are in good agreement with the behavior observed in our simulations of the European air traffic scenario. In addition, we assess the performance of greedy forwarding in the aero-nautical environment and show that, under moderate connectivity, this technique delivers almost all packets to their destinations with a minimum hop count.},

As the networks become denser, more control packets are forwarded, thus consuming more bandwidth and may cause packet loss. Recently, game theory has been applied to address several problems in mobile ad hoc networks like energy efficiency. In this paper, we apply game theory to reduce the control packets in dense networks. We choose a proactive routing protocol, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. We consider two strategies in this method: willingness\_always and willingness\_never to reduce the multipoint relay (MPR) ratio in dense networks. Thus, nodes with less influence on other nodes are excluded from nomination as MPRs. Simulations were used to confirm the efficiency of using our improved method. The results show that the MPR ratio was significantly reduced, and packet delivery ratio was increased compared to the conventional protocol.},

Addressing these challenges requires the design of new protocols and mechanisms specific to this environment.

This provides selectable reliability for multiple applications within highly mobile tactical airborne networks. Our contributions for this environment include the transmission control protocol (TCP)-friendly transport protocol, AeroTP; the IP-compatible network layer, AeroNP; and the geolocation aware routing protocol AeroRP.

This method also reduces the Internet traffic load on satellite nodes and also propagation delay for real-time traffic transmissions, by effectively bypassing the satellite link for nonreal time data. A dynamic routing algorithm is also proposed for efficient routing in this kind of system.

Looking into details, satellite communications currently seems to be the only reliable way to connect and send data on long-distance flights. However, geostationary satellite systems suffer from high propagation delays making Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes beneficial compared to error handling by retransmissions. In this paper, Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) is proposed as a packet level FEC technique for high delay satellite communication. Using emulation, it is shown that correlated losses typical for a satellite channel result in a high variation in the number of redundant symbols required to decode a generation. This can be improved by using interleaving, which comes by the cost of an increased delay. A novel approach is introduced that combines On-the-fly Coding and interleaving. This can significantly reduce the average delay introduced by interleaving and allows to efficiently overcome correlated losses in combination with Network Coding for time-critical applications.},

It is challenging to satisfy required quality of service (QoS) levels for flows within aircraft due to the large number of users and the highly varying air to ground (A2G) link capacities composed of satellite and direct air to ground communication (DA2GC). To represent service quality variations, we propose models for the generated traffic flows from aircraft and variations in A2G links. We present three different forwarding schemes based on priority, delay requirements and history of the dropped flows metrics. Forwarding schemes schedule the flows in real time by choosing either satellite or direct air to ground link depending on the delay and capacity requirements of flows to maximize the number of accepted flows with required QoS guarantees in terms of dropped packets and delay. Also, the effect of local caching is studied to fully satisfy the QoS requirement of flows in simulated flights. We implement the forwarding procedures and caching in ns-3 and test their performance in a current connectivity scenario of 100 Mbps capacity for both the satellite spot and ground base station in a one-hour flight. Our study shows that although the forwarding procedure based on a combination of priority and delay requirement has relatively better performance than the other schemes, which are based on priority only and weighted average of all metrics, in dropped packet percentage and delay, the current connectivity setup is not able to satisfy all QoS requirements. Furthermore, at least 0.9 cache hit rate is required to satisfy all flows for at least 50\% of simulated flights.},

Using a distributed coordination function (DCF), the CSMA/CA protocol reduces collisions and improves the overall throughput. To mitigate fairness issues arising with CSMA/CA, we develop a modified version that we term CSMA with copying collision avoidance (CSMA/CCA). A station in CSMA/CCA contends for the shared wireless medium by employing a binary exponential backoff similar to CSMA/CA. Different from CSMA/CA, CSMA/CCA copies the contention window (CW) size piggybacked in the MAC header of an overheard data frame within its basic service set (BSS) and updates its backoff counter according to the new CW size. Simulations carried out in several WLAN configurations illustrate that CSMA/CCA improves fairness relative to CSMA/CA and offers considerable advantages for deployment in the 802.11-standard-based WLANs.},

  abstract = {Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) is a popular coding scheme to improve communication over lossy channels. For packet streaming applications (video streaming, general IP streams), recent research has shown that sliding window schemes can improve in-order delay properties compared to the block/-generation based coding. However, implementing sliding window RLNC with a limited coding window poses new challenges in both theoretical and engineering aspects. We introduce the first practical generation-less sliding window RLNC scheme, which is built on existing generation based coders. Through discrete simulation and a proof of concept implementation, we show that, the in-order delay can be improved compared to generation based schemes while retaining the reliability, computational complexity and overhead.},

  abstract = {When investigating co-channel spatial reuse, typical studies on ad-hoc networks have adopted static, device-specific transmission/interference ranges regardless of the runtime environment. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to investigate co-channel spatial reuse in dense wireless ad-hoc networks based on RF propagation models for some common network topologies. We derive the minimum separation between simultaneous co-channel transmitters while maintaining desirable signal-noise-interference-ratio at receivers. Spatial reuse is characterized by the ratio between co-channel transmitter (T-T) and transmit-receiver (T-R) distances. Our results show that increasing transmission power improves spatial reuse in ambient noise dominated environments. However, in co-channel interference limited scenarios, increasing transmission power has little effect on spatial reuse. On the other hand, more simultaneous transmissions can be physically possible by decreasing the average T-R separation, independent of transmission power. Our results confirm that the popular practice of using static transmission/interference ranges leads to an oversimplified model that is unable to accurately characterize the spatial reuse (and consequently aggregate network capacity) in ad-hoc networks.},

  abstract = {The engineering vision of relying on the ``smart sky'' for supporting air traffic and the ``internet-above-the-clouds'' for in-flight entertainment has become imperative for the future aircraft industry. Aeronautical ad hoc networking (AANET) constitutes a compelling concept for providing broadband communications above clouds by extending the coverage of air-to-ground (A2G) networks to oceanic and remote airspace via autonomous and self-configured wireless networking among commercial passenger airplanes. The AANET concept may be viewed as a new member of the family of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) in action above the clouds. However, AANETs have more dynamic topologies, larger and more variable geographical network size, stricter security requirements, and more hostile transmission conditions. These specific characteristics lead to more grave challenges in aircraft mobility modeling, aeronautical channel modeling, and interference mitigation as well as in network scheduling and routing. This paper provides an overview of AANET solutions by characterizing the associated scenarios, requirements, and challenges. Explicitly, the research addressing the key techniques of AANETs, such as their mobility models, network scheduling and routing, security, and interference, is reviewed. Furthermore, we also identify the remaining challenges associated with developing AANETs and present their prospective solutions as well as open issues. The design framework of AANETs and the key technical issues are investigated along with some recent research results. Furthermore, a range of performance metrics optimized in designing AANETs and a number of representative multiobjective optimization algorithms are outlined.},
